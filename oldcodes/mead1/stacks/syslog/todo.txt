There's alot to do so I'm jsut including what to revisit here.

When a syslog flush is done, the IP addresses should get associated with a host.
    I think I want to do this by "addHostByIP" on the host objects. This function will be responsible for associating it with the right network/location if a network/location is not provided.
    Need findHostByIP which will later extend to search interfaces.
    Need to also add the collector as a host so that I can simply associate the collectorID.

Log Storage:
    When creating the first batch the program should check and see if this collector has any other batches and close those first.
    Partitioning is needed but I don't know by what factor.
    Disk storage is needed. 
        Add a table to track disk files and what server(s) they are on.
        Disk files can be replicated between servers
        Each log entry will include a line number and a file reference.
