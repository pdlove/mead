Downloaded files from:
https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.1.1/client
This will show you the appropriate imports and you can download the files being imported. 
Make sure to download the .map file as well.
In this case I'm downloading the following:

https://esm.sh/react@19.1.1/es2022/react.mjs to ./react.mjs
https://esm.sh/react@19.1.1/es2022/react.mjs.map to ./react.mjs.map

https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.1.1/es2022/react-dom.mjs to ./react-dom.mjs
https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.1.1/es2022/react-dom.mjs.map to ./react-dom.mjs.map

https://esm.sh/scheduler@0.26.0/es2022/scheduler.mjs to ./scheduler.mjs
https://esm.sh/scheduler@0.26.0/es2022/scheduler.mjs.map to ./scheduler.mjs.map
import "/scheduler@^0.26.0?target=es2022";

https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.1.1/es2022/client.mjs to ./react-dom-client.mjs
https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.1.1/es2022/client.mjs.map to ./react-dom-client.mjs.map

After downloading update any imports in the mjs files. They are all at the very beginning of the file.
